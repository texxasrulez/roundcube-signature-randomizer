# Translations

Language files live in `localization/<locale>.inc`. English is `en_US.inc`.
To translate:
1. Open `localization/en_US.inc` and copy keys to your locale file.
2. Use DeepL (or your translator of choice) to translate values.
3. Keep keys identical.
4. Save as UTF-8.

DeepL tip: paste only the string values, not the PHP syntax. Verify placeholders remain intact if present.
